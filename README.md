## What is this

Little things to keep myself entertained.

There are a couple of dependencies so far for this:

- the utf8 tools in my github repository (which are themselves a dependency of 
	the terminal tools)
- the generic tools in my github repository.
- and the terminal tools in my github repository.

## TODO:

- Choose filename when saving
- Copy contents of cursor!!!
- Maybe a scrollbar?
