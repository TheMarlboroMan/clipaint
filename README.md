# cli paint

## What is this?

Little things to keep myself entertained, namely a small program to paint with your terminal.

There are a couple of dependencies so far for this:

- the utf8 tools in my github repository (which are themselves a dependency of 
	the terminal tools)
- the generic tools in my github repository.
- and the terminal tools in my github repository.

## TODO:

- Maybe a scrollbar?
- h for help.
- A "view drawing only" view
