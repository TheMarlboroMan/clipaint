# cli paint

## What is this

Little things to keep myself entertained.

There are a couple of dependencies so far for this:

- the utf8 tools in my github repository (which are themselves a dependency of 
	the terminal tools)
- and the terminal tools in my github repository.

## TODO:

- The window could be updated in rect chunks.
- Shape selector (32 to 126).
- Save / load.
- Max screen size could be different from canvas, scroll.
